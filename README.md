A chat app built with node.js, express, socket.io, jquery, JSON, html2canvas, and canvas2image.

Inspired by a glitch project by Sylvi Scahill and the hello-express project framework provided by Glitch. 

An anonymous place for sober people to express themselves and recieve feedback. When used by many it provides an endless stream of consciousness in the hope that it will help people stay sober until their next meeting. 

Planning to add screenshot funcitonality on button click:

  -"If you see something of value that will get you through until your next meeting, whether it is great advice, a joke that will keep you smiling, or a story that invokes hope, click "Save Inspiration" and a screenshot of the chat will download onto your device."
