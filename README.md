This space is for when you cannot find an AA or NA meeting. Pick up a keyboard instead of a buzz. If you see something of value that will get you through until your next meeting, whether it is great advice, a joke that will keep you smiling, or a story that invokes hope, click "Save Inspiration" and a screenshot of the chat will download onto your device. Take it one day at a time friends.
